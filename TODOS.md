## TODOS
- [x] Calculate Rarity on build and store on the filesystem
  - [x]  Take all metadata items and analyse their attributes.
  - [x]  Derive a rarity score for each attribute of each NFT item. Example: Property "Type", Attribute "Ape"; 24 of 10000 have this attribute/property combination; rarity_score = 1/(24/10000) = 416.67
  - [x]  Derive a rarity score for each NFT in the collection. The rarity score for each NFT is the sum of all attributes.
  - [x]  Account for missing trait_types of an NFT.
  - [x]  Account for the trait_count of an NFT.
  - [x]  Calculate the Rarity Score for each token (SUM of all rare trait attributes / missing traits / trait counts).
  - [x]  Compute and store a collection-rarities.json file which can be exported for use elsewhere for the given collection.
- [x] Rarity Site
  - [x] Serve collection list with pagination with static build for perf
  - [x] Allow collection token filtering
